The airflow limitation is usually progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to noxious particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking. Although COPD affects the lungs, it also produces significant systemic consequences.\u201d 1 Global burden of disease studies have estimated that COPD is the third leading cause of death worldwide and in the United States. COPD caused more than 3 million deaths in 2010 alone, and is the second leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years lost. 1 COPD is also associated with significant systemic consequences, which include increased prevalence of vascular disease, osteoporosis, muscle wasting, and cancer. 2 At the individual level, COPD imposes a high burden on the patient and their families/caregivers in terms of health-related quality of life and health status. 3\nThe pathophysiology of COPD is complex and characterized by both pulmonary and systemic inflammation that influences the progression of the disease and the development of comorbidities. 4,5 COPD involves infiltration of inflammatory cells and higher circulating and pulmonary concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines. 6 The degree of inflammation in COPD is associated with faster decline in lung function and an increased incidence of related comorbid conditions. 7\nEvidence has revealed that diet and nutrition are associated with the decline in lung function that is the hallmark of COPD, as well as inflammation and other comorbidities that contribute to disease burden. 8, 9, 10 However, the impact of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) and specific nutrition-related interventions on outcomes in COPD are not well described. Current therapies to prevent or treat COPD are limited, therefore, addressing strategies for delaying the development and progression of COPD is very important in improving quality of life (QOL), prolonging survival, and containing cost in patients with COPD.\nIn 2008, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (Academy) published its first COPD Evidence-Based Nutrition Practice Guideline (EBNPG) on the Evidence Analysis Library (EAL; www.andeal.org ). According to the Academy, \u201cEBNPGs are a series of guiding statements that are developed using a systematic process for identifying, analyzing, and synthesizing scientific evidence.\u201d 11 EBNPGs provide timely and comprehensive guidance to assist registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) in decisions about appropriate nutrition care for their patients. During 2014, a new evidence analysis workgroup was formed to update the original EBNPG and was subsequently published on the EAL in August 2019. This publication outlines the methods used to complete the systematic review (SR) and guideline and examines the guideline recommendations and supporting evidence. The COPD EBNPG provides the latest, evidence-based summary of effective practice in the nutrition management of patients with COPD. Principal areas include effectiveness of MNT, methods to estimate energy requirements, macronutrient composition of the diet, impact of body weight (BW), vitamin D supplementation, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) status. Using the Nutrition Care Process (NCP) 12 as a framework for practice, these recommendations begin with individualized nutrition assessment and follow with intervention, and then monitoring and evaluation. Implementation of this EBNPG will assist RDNs and other clinicians in improving the care of patients with COPD.\nGuideline Methodology\nThis SR followed the Academy\u2019s EAL protocol for conducting SRs and developing guidelines, published elsewhere. 11,13 A brief description of methods for the project will be discussed. The complete COPD project can be found on the EAL website. 14\nEvidence Analysis Team\nIn 2015, the Academy\u2019s Evidence Based Practice Committee appointed an eight-member workgroup to evaluate available evidence related to nutrition and COPD. The expert workgroup consisted of six RDNs with extensive experience in COPD nutrition practice and/or research, and two patient advocates. An ad-hoc member with expertise in energy expenditure was also added to the group. The SR team supporting the workgroup included a project manager, a lead analyst, nine evidence analysts, an SR methodologist, and a medical librarian.\nAll workgroup business was conducted via conference calls and through a shared online work environment. The workgroup and other team members met an average of 1 to 2 times per month from June 2015 through July 2019. Workgroup members met to develop research questions, inform the eligibility criteria, screen articles for inclusion, approve evidence summaries, synthesize and grade the conclusion statement evidence, and write the guideline recommendations reflecting consensus of the workgroup.\nResearch Questions, Literature Search, and Eligibility Criteria\nThe workgroup developed eight overarching questions for the SR under the following topics: MNT; methods to estimate energy and protein requirements; energy and macronutrient intake; macronutrient composition; BW and body composition; and micronutrients (vitamin D supplementation and serum 25[OH]D levels). Fifteen outcomes of interest were selected: mortality, lung function/respiratory impairment, acute exacerbations (AECOPD), QOL, functional status, exercise capacity; respiratory symptoms, systemic inflammation/oxidative stress; BW status; body composition; severity, duration, or course of illness, emergency department visits, admissions/readmissions; length of stay; and health care utilization.\nThe search and identification of articles for inclusion was conducted in two phases due to an unforeseen break in the project. During the first phase, the lead analyst completed a literature search in Medline, Embase, and CINAHL databases encompassing inclusion dates of 2001 thorough 2015. During phase II, the medical librarian conducted a second comprehensive literature search using a combination of search terms in the same databases. Eligibility parameters included studies of adults with COPD; aged 18 years or older; published between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2017; conducted within the United States; and published in the English language in peer-reviewed journals. Search term combinations represented the five SR topic areas and COPD ((\u201cPulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive\u201d[Mesh]) OR \u201cCOPD, Severe Early-Onset\u201d [Supplementary Concept]) OR \u201cLung Diseases, Obstructive\u201d[Mesh])) OR (((\u201cChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\u201d[Title/Abstract]) OR copd[Title/Abstract]) OR \u201cObstructive lung Disease\u201d [Title/Abstract])))). A complete list of search terms can be found in the Table (available at www.jandonline.org ).\nA total of 18,408 articles were retrieved from the database searches for all questions and were screened against the a priori inclusion and exclusion criteria found in Figure\u00a01. References from pertinent review articles were also hand-searched and 66 additional articles were found. After removing duplicates, title and abstract screening was completed by the lead analyst, identifying 1,130 articles for review. Full-text articles were reviewed for eligibility criteria by at least two workgroup members with content experience and any discrepancies were discussed with the full workgroup and lead analyst until consensus was reached. Articles not meeting inclusion criteria were excluded from analysis. A total of 79 studies were included in the SR analysis for all questions. Some studies included in the analysis answered more than one question. A list of articles that were excluded during full-text review can be found on the EAL website. 14 The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) diagrams 15 illustrating the study inclusion process can be found in Figure\u00a02 (available at www.jandonline.org ).\nFigure\u00a01.

RDN is a credential granted to nutrition professionals in the United States who have met\u00a0all requirements for credentialing through the CDR, the credentialing agency of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The term RD/RDN (or international equivalent) is used on the EAL to allow for studies conducted outside the United States to be considered in evaluating the effectiveness of MNT. To qualify as international equivalent for international studies, the country of study\u2019s origin should be a member of the ICDA. The credentials for international studies should represent the recognized credentials as stated on ICDA\u2019s website (https://www.internationaldietetics.org/) for that particular country.

Studies published before 2005 were later excluded by the workgroup. 14\nTo reduce the scope of the project, studies published before 2005 were eliminated. Given the large number of studies found in the literature for the vitamin D, BW, and body composition topics, the workgroup also narrowed the outcomes of interest for these topics and excluded certain study designs for the BW and body composition questions. These criteria were considered secondary exclusions.\nData Extraction, Quality Assessment, and Evidence Synthesis\nTrained evidence analysts extracted data from each included article using a web-based platform. Fields extracted included bibliographic information, inclusion criteria, participant characteristics, and quantitative results. Some values were calculated from data provided in the publication or by unpublished data provided by the authors. Where the data were incomplete or unclear, a staff member made an attempt to contact the authors for clarification or request additional data. In addition, the lead analyst and analysts critically appraised each study independently for risk of bias at the study level, using the Academy\u2019s Quality Criteria Checklist. 16 A third review was completed to resolve any differences of opinion and determine a final quality rating of positive, neutral, or negative. Data extraction was reviewed for accuracy and the evidence was synthesized in narrative and table form by the lead analyst.\nA conclusion statement was written to qualitatively summarize evidence for each research question, and the workgroup graded the statement by consensus. Conclusion statements\u2019 grades represent the strength of the evidence and therefore the level of confidence in the findings described: Grade I, Good/Strong; Grade II, Fair; Grade III, Limited/Weak. 11 The evidence grade included consideration of multiple aspects of the included studies, such as the risk of bias across studies, consistency in findings, number of studies and sample sizes, precision of findings, and generalizability to the population of interest. Meta-analysis was not conducted.\nThe evidence was summarized in 30 conclusion statements for the SR portion of the project. A complete list of the evidence analysis questions, conclusions, and grades can be found in Figure\u00a03.\nFigure\u00a03.

Findings for certain lung function parameters (including FVC and Pi max) were mixed. No improvements or negative outcomes were found in other lung function parameters measured.\nGrade II\n4 articles; 3 studies e (3\u00a0+, 1\u00a0\u00d8)\nWhat is the effectiveness of MNT as part of a multidisciplinary program on functional status, exacerbations, systemic inflammation, respiratory symptoms, hospital costs, and admissions outcomes in adults with COPD?\nAs part of a multidisciplinary program, MNT intervention provided by an RDN (or international equivalent) was effective in improving functional status, dyspnea scores, reducing hospital admissions, and lowering hospital admissions costs in adults with COPD. No improvements or negative outcomes were found in the frequency or severity of exacerbations or inflammatory markers.\nGrade III\n3 studies (2\u00a0+, 1 \u00d8)\nWhat is the effectiveness of MNT on outcomes in adults with COPD?\nMNT intervention provided by an RDN (or international equivalent) was effective in improving body weight status, QOL, body composition, lung function (FVC), dyspnea scores, and functional status outcomes in adults with COPD. No improvements or negative outcomes were found in other lung function parameters measured or in exercise capacity (hand-grip strength).\nGrade III\n1 study (1 \u00d8)\nMethods to Estimate Energy Requirements\nIf measurements are not available, what are the best methods to predict energy needs in adults with COPD?\nConclusions for this question should be considered tentative.\nFor prediction of RMR, the Westerterp equation yielded the highest accuracy rate, followed by the WHO (omitting height) equation and HBE, which yielded slightly lower, but similar accuracy rates.\nFor prediction of TEE, 30 kcal/kg body weight in non-obese adults with COPD produced an estimate that was not different from measured values on average, but whose variability was wide indicating that estimation errors might be common and large.\nSynthesis of results for this question was challenging because large gaps exist in the available evidence (small numbers of studies with small sample sizes, inconsistency in the types of statistical treatments from study to study making data difficult to aggregate).\nGrade III\n5 studies (1\u00a0+, 3 \u00d8, 1 \u2013)\nMethods to Estimate Protein Requirements\nWhat is the best method to estimate protein needs in adults with COPD?\nNo evidence was identified to evaluate predictive equations to estimate protein needs in adults with COPD.\nGrade V\nEnergy and Macronutrient Intake\nWhat association exists between energy intake (eg, kcal/kg) and outcomes in adults with COPD?\nEvidence suggests an association between energy intake and some outcomes in adults with COPD. There was improvement in dyspnea scores with higher energy intakes, with less robust evidence supporting a beneficial relationship with functional status, health care utilization or duration of illness. The findings for the impact of energy intake on exacerbations, QOL, weight status, and body composition were mixed, with the majority supportive of an association. The evidence for a relationship between energy intake and lung function, systemic inflammation or exercise capacity was inconsistent. Outcomes varied among these studies, making synthesis of the findings challenging.\nGrade II\n9 studies (1\u00a0+, 6 \u00d8, 2 \u2013)\nWhat association exists between carbohydrate intake (eg, g/kg) and outcomes in adults with COPD?\nVery limited evidence suggests an association between CHO intake and upper and lower body strength or 6-minute walking distance in adults with COPD. No association was found between CHO intake and BMI.\nGrade III\n1 study (1 \u2013)\nWhat association exists between protein intake (eg, g/kg) and outcomes in adults with COPD?\nLimited evidence suggests an association between protein intake and some outcomes in adults with COPD. There was improvement in respiratory symptoms, QOL and functional status with higher protein intakes. A beneficial, but less consistent effect was seen between protein intake and lung function, weight status, body composition, or exercise capacity. The relationship between protein intake and systemic inflammation was inconsistent. Outcomes varied among the studies, making synthesis of the findings challenging.\nGrade III\n4 studies (1\u00a0+, 2 \u00d8, 1 \u2013)\nWhat association exists between fat intake (eg, g/kg) and outcomes in adults with COPD?\nVery limited evidence suggests an association between fat intake and upper body strength in adults with COPD, but not between fat intake and BMI.\nGrade III\n1 study (1 \u2013)\nMacronutrient Composition\nDoes the macronutrient composition (% distribution) of the diet have an effect on outcomes in adults with COPD?\nLimited evidence showed improvement in lung function (FVC, TV), but not FEV 1 or VC when adult men with COPD consumed a higher fat (50%), lower CHO (28%) diet.\nGrade III\n1 study (1 \u2013)\nBody Weight and Composition\nWhat effect does body weight have on mortality outcomes in adults with COPD?\nEvidence suggests an association between body weight status and mortality in adults with COPD. The lowest BMI groups had higher mortality rates when compared to higher BMI groups. A BMI classification of approximately 25.0 to 29.99 appeared to lower the risk of mortality when compared to both higher and lower BMI classifications.\nGrade I\n17 studies (3\u00a0+, 14 \u00d8)\nWhat effect does body weight have on lung function outcomes in adults with COPD?\nEvidence suggests a positive association between BMI and FEV 1 % predicted and FEV 1 /FVC in adults with COPD. In addition, a longitudinal study showed that increasing BMI reduced the decline in these measures over time. However, most results did not include adjustment for relevant confounders and should be interpreted with caution. Results were either mixed or not significant for other lung function measures (FEV 1, FVC, FVC\u00a0% predicted).\nGrade II\n8 studies (1\u00a0+, 6 \u00d8, 1 \u2013)\nWhat effect does body composition have on mortality outcomes in adults with COPD?\nLimited evidence suggests that a lower FFMI and \"muscle atrophy\" [defined as (kg/m 2) BMI \u226521 and FFMI <16 (men) or <15 (women)], but not FMI is associated with higher mortality in both underweight and overweight adults with COPD. Higher mortality risk was also seen in groups of patients with \"muscle atrophy\" (as previously defined).\nGrade III\n3 studies (1\u00a0+, 2 \u00d8)\nWhat effect does body composition have on lung function outcomes in adults with COPD?\nVery limited evidence from a single study showed that underweight COPD subjects with muscle and fat store depletions had lower FEV 1 and FEV 1 /FVC, compared to normal and overweight COPD subjects with or without muscle or fat store depletion. No differences were found for other lung function measures (FEV 1 % predicted, FVC or FVC % predicted).\nGrade III\n1 study (1 \u00d8)\nMicronutrients\nDoes vitamin D supplementation improve lung function and exacerbation outcomes in adults with COPD?\nEvidence from adults with COPD with BL serum 25(OH)D levels \u226410 ng/mL, f showed that vitamin D supplementation decreased exacerbations. The evidence related to the effect of supplementation on lung function and exacerbation outcomes for COPD patients with higher serum 25(OH)D levels was inconclusive due to mixed findings. Synthesis of the results was challenging due to lack of consistency in vitamin D dosing, dosing frequency and delivery routes, length of intervention and BL serum 25(OH)D levels.\nGrade II\n8 studies (4\u00a0+, 3 \u00d8, 1 \u2013)\nDoes vitamin D supplementation improve mortality outcomes in adults with COPD?\nA single study examining vitamin D supplementation and mortality as a secondary outcome found no significant difference in mortality rate in adults with COPD.\nGrade III\n1 study (1\u00a0+)\nWhat associations exist between serum 25(OH)D levels and mortality, lung function, and exacerbation outcomes in adults with COPD?\nThe evidence for the relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and lung function and exacerbation outcomes in adults with COPD yielded mixed findings. Sixty percent of studies examining serum 25(OH)D and lung function outcomes found a positive association; 36% of studies examining exacerbation outcomes found a positive association. No studies examining serum 25(OH)D and mortality found an association.\nGrade II\n29 articles; 28 studies e\n(8\u00a0+, 20 \u00d8, 1 \u2013)\na\nGray shading indicates conclusion statement supports one or more 2019 COPD Evidence-Based Nutrition Practice Guideline Recommendations (see Figure\u00a05 ).\nb\n25(OH)D=25-hydroxyvitamin D; BL=baseline; BMI=body mass index (calculated as kg/m 2 ); FEV 1 =forced expiratory volume in 1 minute; FFMI=fat-free mass index; FMI=fat mass index; FVC=forced vital capacity; HBE=Harris-Benedict equation; Pi max =maximum inspiratory mouth pressure; QOL=quality of life; RDN=registered dietitian nutritionist; RMR=resting metabolic rate; TEE=total energy expenditure; TV=tidal volume; VC=vital capacity; WHO=World Health Organization.\nc\nGrade I=Good/Strong, Grade II=Fair, Grade III=Limited/Weak, Grade IV=Expert Opinion Only, Grade V=Not Assignable.\nd\nNumber of studies and quality rating (positive [+], neutral [\u00d8] or negative ]\u2013]) included in the Evidence Analysis Library systematic review conclusion statement.\ne\nNumber of papers includes a secondary analysis of an included study.\nf\nTo convert ng/mL 25-hydroxyvitamin D to nmol/L, multiply ng/mL by 2.496.

Not all evidence analysis questions were used to develop recommendations because only limited or conflicting evidence was found for some topics or outcomes of interest, or no evidence was found to\u00a0answer the research question (ie,\u00a0methods to estimate protein requirements). For the methods to estimate energy requirements topic, a separate conclusion statement was written for each of the 12 different predictive equations found in the literature. However, only the overall summary was used to support the recommendation for assessment of energy needs. See Figure\u00a03 for the conclusion statements used to support the guideline recommendations.\nFigure\u00a05. Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Evidence Analysis Library Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) 2019 Evidence-Based Nutrition Practice Guideline recommendations.\nRecommendation a\nRating; classification 13\nScreening and referral\nNone\nNutrition assessment\n1. COPD: Assessment of Energy Intake\nThe RDN should assess the energy intake of adults with COPD. Evidence suggests there was improvement in dyspnea scores with higher energy intakes. In addition, less robust evidence supported a beneficial relationship with functional status, health care utilization, or duration of illness.\nFair; Imperative\n2. COPD: Assessment of Body Weight\nThe RDN should assess BMI (calculated as kg/m 2) or other measures of body weight in adults with COPD. Strong evidence suggests an association between body weight status and mortality in adults with COPD. The lowest BMI groups had higher mortality rates when compared to higher BMI groups. Furthermore, a BMI classification of approximately 25.0 to 29.99 appeared to lower the risk of mortality when compared to both higher and lower BMI classifications. In primarily unadjusted results, there was fair evidence of a positive association between BMI and FEV 1 % predicted and FEV 1 /FVC. An increasing BMI was also shown to reduce longitudinal declines in these measures over time.\nStrong; Imperative\n3. COPD: Assessment of Energy Needs\n3.1.\nCOPD: Estimating Resting Metabolic Rate\nTo calculate resting metabolic rate in adults with COPD, the RDN may use either the WHO (including height) equation or the Harris-Benedict equation. If body composition is known (FFM, body fat), the RDN may use the Westerterp equation. Limited evidence showed that the Westerterp equation has a prediction accuracy rate of 68%, followed by the WHO (including height) (63%), and Harris-Benedict (61%) equations.\nWeak; Conditional\n3.2.\nCOPD: Estimating Total Energy Expenditure\nTo calculate total energy expenditure in nonobese adults with COPD, the RDN may use 30 kcal/kg body weight to estimate energy needs. Limited evidence suggests that 30 kcal/kg body weight in non-obese adults with COPD produced an estimate that was not different from measured values on average, but whose variability was wide indicating that estimation errors might be common and large.\nWeak; Imperative\n4. COPD: Assessment of Serum 25(OH)D Status\n4.1.\nCOPD: Assessment of Serum 25(OH)D Levels\nThe RDN should assess serum 25(OH)D levels in adults with COPD as part of a routine nutrition assessment. Evidence from 60% of studies reviewed found positive associations between serum 25(OH)D and lung function measures.\nFair; Imperative\n4.2.\nCOPD: Assessment of Exacerbations\nIf an adult with COPD is having two or more exacerbations per year, the RDN should assess 25(OH)D levels. Evidence from adults with COPD with BL serum 25(OH)D levels \u226410 ng/mL (25 nmol/L), b showed that vitamin D supplementation decreased exacerbations.\nFair; Conditional\nNutrition diagnosis\nNone\nNutrition intervention\n5. COPD: Medical Nutrition Therapy\nThe RDN should provide medical nutrition therapy to adults with COPD to improve patient outcomes. Evidence indicates that medical nutrition therapy intervention provided by an RDN (or international equivalent) as part of a multidisciplinary program was effective in improving body weight status, QOL, exercise capacity, and body composition outcomes in adults with COPD.\nStrong; Imperative\n6. COPD: Energy Prescription\nFor adults with COPD, the RDN should individualize the calorie prescription based on a nutrition assessment of energy intake, body weight and estimated energy needs to achieve and maintain an optimal weight status. Strong evidence indicates that the lowest BMI groups had higher mortality rates when compared to higher BMI groups. A BMI classification of approximately 25.0 to 29.99 appeared to lower risk of mortality when compared to both higher and lower BMI classifications. Furthermore, fair evidence suggests that higher energy intakes improved dyspnea scores and also showed a beneficial but less robust relationship with functional status, health care utilization or duration of illness. In primarily unadjusted results, fair evidence suggests a positive association between BMI and FEV 1 percentage predicted and FEV 1 /FVC. An increasing BMI was also shown to reduce longitudinal declines in these measures over time.\nFair; Imperative\n7. COPD: Macronutrient Composition (% Distribution)\nThe RDN should individualize the macronutrient composition of the diet based on nutrition assessment. Limited evidence examining the impact of macronutrient distribution did not confirm an ideal percentage distribution of CHO, protein and fat, or if macronutrient distribution should be different for adults with COPD.\nFair; Imperative\n8. COPD: Vitamin D Supplementation\n8.1.\nCOPD: Vitamin D Supplementation for Serum 25(OH)D Levels \u226410 ng/mL (\u226425 nmol/L) b\nIf an adult with COPD has serum 25(OH)D levels \u226410 ng/mL (\u226425 nmol/L), b the RDN should advise vitamin D supplementation to optimize serum 25(OH)D status. Evidence from adults with COPD with BL serum 25(OH)D levels \u226410 ng/mL, b showed that vitamin D supplementation decreased exacerbations.\nFair; Conditional\n8.2.\nCOPD: Vitamin D Supplementation for Serum 25(OH)D Levels 11 to 29 ng/mL (27.5 to 72.5 nmol/L) b\nIf an adult with COPD has serum 25(OH)D levels 11 to 29 ng/mL (27.5 to 72.5 nmol/L), b the RDN should consider vitamin D supplementation to optimize serum 25(OH)D status. While vitamin D is important for health, evidence indicates that vitamin D supplementation may or may not improve lung function or reduce exacerbations in adults with COPD who have BL serum levels within this range. Evidence related to the effect of vitamin D supplementation on lung function and exacerbation outcomes yielded mixed findings and depended upon on dosing, dosing frequency and delivery routes, length of intervention and BL serum 25(OH)D levels.\nFair; Conditional\nNutrition monitoring and evaluation\n9. COPD: Monitor and Evaluate Energy Intake and Body Weight for Energy Needs\nFor adults with COPD, the RDN should routinely monitor and evaluate body weight status and energy intake and adjust the estimated calorie prescription to achieve or maintain an optimal weight. Evidence suggests an association between body weight status and both mortality and lung function in adults with COPD. Strong evidence indicates that the lowest BMI groups had higher mortality rates when compared to higher BMI groups. Furthermore, a BMI classification of approximately 25.0 29.99 appeared to lower risk of mortality when compared to both higher and lower BMI classifications. In primarily unadjusted results, fair evidence indicates that BMI was positively associated with FEV 1 % predicted and FEV 1 /FEV. An increasing BMI was also shown to reduce longitudinal declines in these measures over time. Fair evidence was also found showing improvement in dyspnea scores with higher energy intakes.\nFair; Imperative\n10. COPD: Monitor and Evaluate Serum 25(OH)D Status\nThe RDN should periodically check serum 25(OH)D levels in adults with COPD as part of a routine nutrition monitoring and evaluation. Evidence from 60% of studies reviewed found positive associations between serum 25(OH)D and lung function measures.\nFair; Imperative\n11. COPD: Monitor and Evaluate Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation\nIn adults with COPD who are receiving vitamin D supplementation, the RDN should monitor and evaluate the effect of the supplementation regimen on serum 25(OH)D levels. If BL serum 25(OH)D levels were \u226410 ng/mL, b the RDN should also evaluate the frequency of exacerbations to measure the effectiveness of supplementation. Evidence from adults with COPD with BL serum 25(OH)D levels \u226410 ng/mL, b showed that vitamin D supplementation decreased exacerbations. While vitamin D is important for general health, vitamin D supplementation in those with BL serum 25(OH)D levels 11 to 29 ng/mL b may or may not improve lung function or reduce exacerbations in adults with COPD.\nFair; Conditional\na\n25(OH)D=25-hydroxyvitamin D; BL=baseline; BMI=body mass index; COPD=chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; FEV 1 =forced expiratory volume in one second; FVC=forced vital capacity; QOL=quality of life; RDN=registered dietitian nutritionist; WHO=World Health Organization.\nb\nTo convert ng/mL 25-hydroxyvitamin D to nmol/L, multiply ng/mL by 2.496.

After the review, the workgroup prepared responses to each comment and made revisions as indicated, by consensus. The guideline was published on the EAL in August 2019. 14\nGuideline Recommendations\nThe 14 recommendations (Figure\u00a05) that make up the Academy\u2019s 2019 COPD EBNPG are based on the EAL systematic review. Recommendations are presented within the context of the NCP. 17 Recommendations 1 through 4.2 are part of nutrition assessment, 5 through 10 are nutrition intervention, and 9 through 11 are nutrition monitoring and evaluation. There are no nutrition diagnosis recommendations.\nThese guideline recommendations were developed for adults in all stages of COPD, regardless of source of diagnosis and for patients in all settings, except critical care. This guideline is not intended for prevention of COPD in those without COPD or for those with other pulmonary diagnoses, such as asthma, pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease, and asthma-COPD overlap syndrome. While adults with COPD with and without comorbid conditions were included in the review, careful consideration should be given to the application of these guidelines for patients with significant medical comorbidities. Clinical judgment should be used in the application of these guidelines.\nFor each of the recommendations, the rationale briefly summarizes the evidence supporting the recommendation.\nRecommendation 1. COPD: Assessment of Energy Intake\nThe RDN should assess the energy intake of adults with COPD. Evidence suggests there was improvement in dyspnea scores with higher energy intakes. In addition, less robust evidence supported a beneficial relationship with functional status, health care utilization, or duration of illness. Rating: Fair; Imperative\nRationale: The recommendation is based on Fair (Grade II) evidence from nine studies, including four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 18, 19, 20, 21 and six cross-sectional studies. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26\nThree studies found significant associations between higher energy intakes and dyspnea scores. 20,21,23 One study found an inverse association between total calorie intake and modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scores in adjusted models. 23 The other two studies found associations between energy intake and dyspnea scores at 12 weeks within, but not between groups 20 and at 6 months between groups, 21 with use of supplemental calorie sources. Evidence of a positive association was also found between energy intake and functional status, as measured by activities of daily living scores 21 health care utilization (number of infections requiring antibiotics) 18 and duration of disease in years. 25\nFindings were mixed for the impact of energy intake on exacerbations, 19,23 QOL, 19, 20, 21 weight status, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and body composition, 19, 20, 21 with the majority supportive of an association. The evidence for a relationship between energy intake and lung function, 19, 20, 21,23,26 systemic inflammation, 20 or exercise capacity 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 was inconsistent. Outcomes varied among these studies, making synthesis of the findings challenging.\nRecommendation 2. COPD: Assessment of Body Weight Status\nThe RDN should assess body mass index (BMI; calculated as kg/m 2) or other measures of BW in adults with COPD. Strong evidence suggests an association between BW status and mortality in adults with COPD. The lowest BMI groups had higher mortality rates compared to higher BMI groups. Furthermore, a BMI classification of approximately 25.0 to 29.99 appeared to lower the risk of mortality compared to both higher and lower BMI classifications. In primarily unadjusted results, there was fair evidence of a positive association between BMI and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) % predicted and FEV 1 /forced vital capacity (FVC). An increasing BMI was also shown to reduce longitudinal declines in these measures over time. Rating: Strong; Imperative\nRationale: The recommendation is based on Good/Strong (Grade I) evidence for mortality from 17 studies, including 9 prospective cohorts 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 and eight retrospective cohorts, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 and Fair (Grade II) evidence for AECOPD outcomes from eight studies including four prospective cohorts, 27, 28, 29,44 one of which was a longitudinal study, 44 three retrospective cohorts, 37,45,46 and one case\u2013control study. 47\nBW and Mortality\nFive studies 28,29,35,38,39 evaluated BW between survivors and nonsurvivors with COPD. A significantly higher BMI was found in survivors compared to nonsurvivors in four studies, 29,35,38,39 while one study 28 found no differences in BMI between groups.\nSix studies 27,30,32,37,41,43 evaluated differences in mortality rates between BMI categories. Among studies comparing mortality rates between BMI categories, a lower risk of mortality was found as BMI classification increased. Likewise, those in the lowest BMI groups had higher mortality rates compared to those in higher BMI groups. Two studies 27,37 classified the BMIs of participants into quintiles and quartiles, respectively, and found a lower risk of mortality as BMI categorization increased.\nIn three studies 30,32,41 that were unadjusted for confounding variables, two found higher mortality in the lowest BMI groups. 30,32 In these studies, a higher mortality 2 years after AECOPD was found in the lowest BMI group compared to the 23 to 24.9 BMI group 30 and a higher mortality was found in the lowest BMI group compared to the next higher group (both with severe COPD). 32 The third study 41 found no significant differences in cumulative survival rate between all BMI groups. In patients hospitalized for AECOPD, one study 43 found that an obese group (using ICD-9 48 codes) had a 51% reduction in risk of mortality compared to a normal-weight group, after adjusting for possible confounders.\nEleven studies 28,29,31,33, 34, 35, 36,38, 39, 40,42 evaluated BMI and weight status as a predictor of mortality. Five studies evaluated BMI (or percent reference weight) as a continuous variable as a predictor of mortality in subjects with COPD. Two studies 34,39 found BMI was a predictor in univariate analysis, two studies 36,39 found BMI was a predictor in multivariate analysis, and one study 28 found a nonsignificant association between BMI and mortality in multivariate analysis. The fifth study 40 that used percent reference weight did not find an association with mortality.\nWhile increasing BW appeared to be protective when BMI was evaluated as a continuous variable, seven studies 29,31,33,35,36,38,42 evaluated BMI as a categorical variable as a predictor of mortality and adjusted for confounding variables. These studies found that a BMI of approximately 25.0 to 29.99 had a lower risk of mortality compared to both higher and lower BMI classifications.\nBW and Lung Function\nAll six studies 28,29,44, 45, 46, 47 evaluating FEV 1% predicted and three studies evaluating FEV 1 /FVC 27,44,46 as outcomes found a positive association with BMI or BMI category. In addition, the longitudinal study 44 also showed that increasing BMI reduced declines in these measures over time. While these studies appear to indicate that increasing BMI is associated with improvements in FEV 1% predicted and FEV 1 /FVC, most results did not include adjustment for relevant confounders and should be interpreted with caution.\nResults for other lung function measures were either mixed for FEV 1 27,28,37,45 and FVC% predicted, 27,28,46 or no association was found between BW and FVC. 28,46\nRecommendation 3. COPD: Assessment of Energy Needs\nRecommendation 3.1. COPD: Estimating Resting Metabolic Rate\nTo calculate resting metabolic rate (RMR) in adults with COPD, the RDN can use either the World Health Organization (WHO) (including height) equation or the Harris-Benedict equation (HBE). If body composition is known (fat-free mass [FFM], body fat), the RDN can use the Westerterp equation. Limited evidence showed that the Westerterp equation has a prediction accuracy rate of 68%, followed by the WHO (including height) (63%) and Harris-Benedict (61%) equations. Rating: Weak; Conditional\nRationale: This recommendation is based on Limited/Weak (Grade III) evidence from five studies, including three cross-sectional studies 49, 50, 51 and two diagnostic, validity, or reliability studies. 52,53 Conclusions should be considered tentative.\nEleven equations were tested for validity in predicting RMR. Two equations (Moore and Angelillo; Nordenson) were equations developed specifically for COPD patients, while the other equations were developed for healthy adults (HBE; Mifflin St Jeor; Westerterp; de Oliveira; Owen; and four variations of Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/WHO/United Nations University, which were WHO [including height], WHO [omitting height]), Nordic Nutrition Recommendation, and the Schofield equation). Not all equations were studied to the same extent. For example, while the HBE was tested in four studies, fully 6 of the 11 equations were tested in only one study. Full details of each predictive equation tested in COPD subjects can be found on the EAL.\nEquation validity is a term used to describe the degree to which the equation reflects the measured RMR. Typically, a composite of techniques are used in defining validity. These techniques should in some way indicate the tendency for the equation to overestimate or underestimate the true value (bias), the overall spread or range of errors (limits of agreement [LOA]), and the percentage of estimates falling within an arbitrary limit above or below the true value (accuracy). The approach taken by the workgroup was to place emphasis on accuracy rate because this parameter seems to be the most important for the clinician making assessments on individual patients. In other words, an equation with a high accuracy rate that is biased toward underestimation would be preferred to an unbiased estimator with a large number of errors. In any case, the five validation studies available for analysis more commonly employed Bland-Altman statistics, which emphasize the spread of error (LOA and proportional and systematic bias).\nBased on best-available evidence, the Westerterp equation yields the highest accuracy for predicting RMR in patients with COPD. 53 This conclusion is based on a single study of 41 subjects. 53 The accuracy rate was 68%, which is the highest accuracy rate reported for any equation applied to patients with COPD. Bias of the equation is not known definitively. Based purely on differences in means of predicted and measured values, the Westerterp equation may be unbiased, 53 or it may tend to overestimate measured RMR. 52 The Westerterp equation requires body composition measurements (FFM and body fat) for its calculation; thus, its usefulness in clinical care may be limited.\nIn the more common instance where FFM is not known, the highest accuracy rates are for the WHO (including height) equation (63%) and the HBE (61%). Again, these results are from a single study of 41 subjects. 53 In this same study, both the WHO equation and HBE exhibited proportional bias (at low RMR the error tends to be most negative, increasing linearly to a positive error as RMR increases). Bias of the HBE and WHO (including height) equations was difficult to ascertain. Less-than-ideal bias indicators were applied in most of the available studies (differences between means). 50,52,53 HBE was shown to overestimate RMR in one study 50 and to be equivalent to measured RMR in two studies. 52,53 The WHO (including height) equation was found to be equivalent to measured RMR in one study. 53 In one study, both HBE and WHO (including height) were found to be biased toward underestimating true RMR, 51 but this study had an important methodological difference from all other studies in this analysis, which could explain its contradictory findings (ie, face mask was used for gas collection instead of rigid canopy).\nRecommendation 3.2. COPD: Estimating Total Energy Expenditure\nTo calculate total energy expenditure (TEE) in nonobese adults with COPD, the RDN can use 30 kcal/kg BW to estimate energy needs. Limited evidence suggests that 30 kcal/kg BW in nonobese adults with COPD produced an estimate that was not different from measured values, on average, but variability was wide, indicating that estimation errors might be common and large. Rating: Weak; Imperative\nRationale: This recommendation is based on Limited/Weak (Grade III) evidence from two cross-sectional studies 49,50 and, therefore, conclusions should be considered tentative. Because the recommendation applies to nonobese adults with COPD, the RDN should use clinical judgment in applying the recommendation to patients with BMI \u226530. Three methods for calculating TEE in adults with COPD were tested.\nWHO (omitting height)\u00a0\u00d7 1.7\nThis TEE method has not been tested for accuracy. The LOA between calculated and measured TEE was wide (\u00b148%). The equation is probably biased toward overestimation based on mean difference between estimated and measured TEE. 49\nRMR\u00a0\u00d7 physical activity level\nWhen physical activity was assessed with pedometers and converted to a physical activity level multiplier, the best result occurred for WHO (omitting height)\u00a0\u00d7 physical activity level (among six equations tested). This method was accurate 67% of the time. It requires measurement of activity with a pedometer. 50\n30 kcal/kg\nThis prediction method for TEE yielded a small difference from measured TEE (71 kcal/day) and so is probably unbiased. However, LOA was \u00b148%, indicating a wide range of errors. 49\nFor both RMR and TEE predictive equations, errors in individual estimates may be high. Overall, the literature on prediction of metabolic rates in patients with COPD is not well-developed, and so recommendations for practice are of limited strength.\nThe RDN should use clinical judgment in determining the BW value used in calculations. Use of adjustments to BW for obesity or volume status were not mentioned anywhere in the available studies. Calculation of energy needs (estimation) using a predictive equation is a starting point to determine energy requirements. For more information, see Recommendation 6.

COPD: Assessment of Serum 25(OH)D Levels\nThe RDN should assess serum 25(OH)D levels in adults with COPD as part of a routine nutrition assessment. Evidence from 60% of studies reviewed found positive associations between serum 25(OH)D and lung function measures. Rating: Fair; Imperative\nRationale: A total of 29 articles from\u00a028 studies provide Fair (Grade II) evidence for the recommendation,\u00a0including 14 cross-sectional studies, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67 6 prospective cohort studies, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73 4 retrospective cohort studies, 74, 75, 76, 77 2 RCTs 78,79 1 before-and-after study, 80 1 descriptive study, 81 and 1 case-control study. 82\nSerum 25(OH)D and lung function\nTwenty-three studies evaluated the relationship between serum 25(OH)D values and lung function in subjects with COPD. Fourteen studies found significant relationships between serum 25(OH)D and lung function outcomes (ie, as serum 25(OH)D increased, lung function values improved) including FEV 1,54,55,57,69,79 FEV 1% predicted, 57,58,64,65,67,69,71,80,81 FEV, 79 FVC% predicted, 58,65,71,74,80 FEV 1 /FVC, 63,67,69,79,80 or total lung capacity, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide and maximal inspiratory mouth pressure. 79 Nine studies did not find significant relationships between serum 25(OH)D and FEV 1,56,61,66,68,71,74,75,78,82 FEV 1% predicted, 59,62,68,75 FVC, 66,68 FVC % predicted, 62 FEV 1 /FVC, 58,75 maximal expiratory mouth pressure, 79 or vital capacity % predicted and maximal expiratory flow at 50% of the FVC levels. 75\nSerum 25(OH)D and AECOPD\nEleven studies evaluated the relationship between serum 25(OH)D values and AECOPD. Only 36% of these studies 67,71,75,81 found significant relationships between serum 25(OH)D and AECOPD outcomes (ie, as serum 25[OH]D increased, AECOPD outcomes improved). These included hospitalizations for AECOPD, 67,75 frequency, 67,71,75 and risk of AECOPD. 81 Seven studies 60,64,69,72,73,77,82 did not find significant relationships between serum 25(OH)D and the severity, 60 duration 73 and frequency 60,64,69,70,72,73 of AECOPD and hospitalizations for AECOPD. 77\nSerum 25(OH)D and mortality\nFive studies 68,71,72,76,77 evaluating the serum 25(OH)D values and mortality found no significant relationships.\nRecommendation 4.2. COPD: Assessment of Exacerbations\nIf an adult with COPD is having two or more exacerbations per year, the RDN should assess 25(OH)D levels. Evidence from adults with COPD with baseline (BL) serum 25(OH)D levels \u226410 ng/mL (\u226425 nmol/L) showed that vitamin D supplementation decreased exacerbations. Rating: Fair; Conditional\nRationale: The recommendation is based on Fair (Grade II) evidence from two studies, including one RCT 83 and one before-and-after study. 84 These studies were included in a more comprehensive evidence review outlined in Recommendation 8.2. COPD: Vitamin D Supplementation for Serum 25(OH)D Levels 11 to 29 ng/mL (27.5 to 72.5 nmol/L).\nBoth studies evaluated the frequency of AECOPD in those with BL serum 25(OH)D <10 ng/mL (<25 nmol/L). 83,84 Supplementation with 100,000 IU oral vitamin D3 every 4 weeks over 12 months resulted in a 43% decrease in AECOPD rate in a subgroup of subjects with \u201csevere deficiency\u201d (25[OH]D <10 ng/mL) (<25 nmol/L). 83 Supplementation with 50,000 IU oral vitamin D3 per week for 8 weeks, then 800 IU daily for 12 months resulted in a decrease in number of AECOPDs and an improvement in maximum voluntary ventilation, but no impact on other lung function outcomes in subjects with 25(OH)D <10 ng/mL (<25 nmol/L) at BL. 84\nThe recommendation refers to COPD patients with frequent exacerbations, defined as two or more exacerbations per year. 85,86 Exacerbations are clinically defined as episodes of increasing respiratory symptoms, particularly dyspnea, cough, and sputum production, and increased sputum purulence. 87 The patient perception of an exacerbation is seeking treatment for symptoms; the research criteria is treatment with antibiotics or addition of increased inhaled or systemic steroids. If serum 25(OH)D laboratory data are not available, the RDN should use professional judgment to request or obtain additional data. Costs may be incurred due to initial laboratory testing to evaluate serum 25(OH)D levels.\nRecommendation 5. COPD: Medical Nutrition Therapy\nThe RDN should provide MNT to adults with COPD to improve patient outcomes. Evidence indicates that MNT intervention provided by an RDN (or international equivalent) as part of a multidisciplinary program was effective in improving BW status, QOL, exercise capacity, and body composition outcomes in adults with COPD. Rating: Strong; Imperative\nRationale: The recommendation is based on Good/Strong (Grade I) for BW status, QOL, and exercise capacity outcomes and Fair (Grade II) evidence for BW and lung function outcomes from a total of six articles (five studies) including one RCT, 88 one before-and-after clinical trial 89 and a secondary analysis, 90 one non-controlled trial, 91 one non-randomized trial, 92 and one prospective cohort. 93\nThe studies evaluated COPD subjects receiving MNT intervention by an RDN (or international equivalent) compared to COPD control groups receiving standard or usual care. All studies were conducted outside the United States. The term international equivalent allows for studies conducted outside the United States to be considered in evaluating the effectiveness of MNT. To be included as an international equivalent, the country of origin of the study\u2019s\u00a0dietitian must be a member of the International Confederation of Dietetic Associations (https://www.internationaldietetics.org/ ). Multidisciplinary interventions, such as pulmonary rehabilitation, which included MNT, were evaluated in all studies. The MNT interventions included individualized MNT in a one-to-one session (eg, home visits, nutrition assessment, and counseling) and as part of group education.\nTwo articles reported improvements in BW 89,91 and percentage ideal BW. 91 Three articles reported BMI maintenance or improvements in BMI, 88,89,92 while nonsignificant differences in BMI were found in one study. 93 No differences in percentage weight change were found. 90 Improvements in QOL were reported by four articles, as measured by St George's Respiratory Questionnaire scores 88,89,93 and Three Factor Eating Questionnaire scores. 90 One article did not find significant improvements in Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire scores. 92 All five articles (four studies) evaluating exercise capacity outcomes reported improvements in quadriceps average power, 88 Short Physical Performance Battery tests, 89 total physical activity, 90 and walking distance, as measured by 6-minute walking distance, 88,89 12-minute walking distance, 91 incremental shuttle walk test, 93 and hand-grip strength. 91\nThree articles (two studies) reported improvements in body composition outcomes, including body fat mass, 89 FFM, 88 percentage body fat, 89 waist circumference, 90 and waist-to-hip ratio. 89 One study did not find differences in skeletal muscle mass or appendicular skeletal muscle mass index. 89 Three studies 88,89,92 found no improvements or negative outcomes in lung function parameters.\nRecommendation 6. COPD: Energy Prescription\nFor adults with COPD, the RDN should individualize the calorie prescription based on a nutrition assessment of energy intake, BW, and estimated energy needs to achieve and maintain an optimal weight status. Strong evidence indicates that the lowest BMI groups had higher mortality rates compared to higher BMI groups. A BMI classification of approximately 25.0 to 29.99 appeared to lower risk of mortality compared to both higher and lower BMI classifications. Furthermore, fair evidence suggests that higher energy intakes improved dyspnea scores and also showed a beneficial but less robust relationship with functional status, health care utilization, or duration of illness. In primarily unadjusted results, fair evidence suggests a positive association between BMI and FEV 1% predicted and FEV 1 /FVC. An increasing BMI was also shown to reduce the longitudinal declines in these measures over time. Rating: Fair; Imperative\nRationale: The evidence supporting this recommendation is described in Recommendation 1. COPD: Assessment of Energy Intake; Recommendation 2. COPD: Assessment of Body Weight; and Recommendation 3. COPD: Assessment of Energy Needs.\nThe RDN should use clinical judgment in providing a calorie prescription. Calculation of energy needs (estimation) using a predictive equation is a starting point to determine energy requirements. Changes in BW should be monitored as an indicator that energy needs should be re-evaluated. Over time, the monitoring of BW and composition against energy intake is probably the most meaningful expression of energy requirements in COPD. It is important to remember in this type of assessment that if adverse changes in BW or composition are occurring, equal attention should be paid to the possibility that the patient is not consuming the target intake, or that the target intake is not correct. In addition, an optimal BW goal should be individualized for each patient.\nRecommendation 7. COPD: Macronutrient Composition (Percent Distribution)\nThe RDN should individualize the macronutrient composition of the diet based on nutrition assessment. Limited evidence examining the impact of macronutrient distribution did not confirm an ideal percentage distribution of carbohydrate, protein, and fat, or whether macronutrient distribution should be different for adults with COPD. Rating: Fair; Imperative\nRationale: The recommendation is based on Limited/Weak (Grade III) evidence from one non-randomized trial. 94 Very limited evidence from one small study (n=30 males) of short duration, showed improvement in lung function (FVC, tidal volume, but not FEV 1 or vital capacity) when adult men with COPD consumed a higher-fat (50%), lower-carbohydrate (28%) diet. 95 Because evidence was limited, and until more evidence is found evaluating various macronutrient distributions, individualization of the macronutrient composition of the diet should be implemented. Comorbid conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and lifestyle, financial barriers, and personal preferences should be considered when individualizing the macronutrient distribution.\nRecommendation 8. Vitamin D Supplementation\nRecommendation 8.1. COPD: Vitamin D Supplementation for Serum 25(OH)D Levels \u226410 ng/L (\u226425 nmol/L)\nIf an adult with COPD has serum 25(OH)D levels \u226410 ng/mL (\u226425 nmol/L), the RDN should advise vitamin D supplementation to optimize serum 25(OH)D status. Evidence from adults with COPD with BL serum 25(OH)D levels \u226410 ng/mL (\u226425 nmol/L) showed that vitamin D supplementation decreased exacerbations. Rating: Fair; Conditional\nRationale: The evidence supporting this recommendation is described in Recommendation 4.2. COPD: Assessment of Exacerbations.\nRecommendation 8.2: COPD: Vitamin D Supplementation for Serum 25(OH)D Levels 11 to 29 ng/mL (27.5 to 72.5 nmol/L)\nIf an adult with COPD has serum 25(OH)D levels of 11 to 29 ng/mL (27.5 to 72.5 nmol/L), the RDN should consider vitamin D supplementation to optimize serum 25(OH)D status. While vitamin D is important for health, evidence indicates that vitamin D supplementation may or may not improve lung function or reduce exacerbations in adults with COPD who have BL serum levels within this range. Evidence related to the effect of vitamin D supplementation on lung function and exacerbation outcomes yielded mixed findings and depended on on dosing, dosing frequency and delivery routes, length of intervention, and BL serum 25(OH)D levels. Rating: Fair; Conditional\nRationale: This recommendation is based on Fair (Grade II) evidence from seven studies including six RCTs 78,83,95, 96, 97, 98 and one before-after study. 80 The recommendation applies to those with BL serum 25(OH)D levels that are\u00a0classified as insufficient (21 to 29 ng/mL [52.5 to 72.5 nmol/L]) or deficient (<20 ng/mL [<50 nmol/L]), according to the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines (ESG). 99 Serum 25(OH)D levels \u226530 ng/mL (>75 nmol/L) are considered sufficient. 99\nFour studies 78,83,95,96 provided subjects\u2019 pre- and post-supplementation levels, allowing changes in vitamin D status to be assessed. No impact on lung function or AECOPD outcomes were found in those with deficient BL 25(OH)D levels who achieved sufficient 25(OH)D levels after oral supplementation with 1,200 IU vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) daily for 6 months (plus 400 IU daily, if desired). 96 In those with insufficient BL serum 25(OH)D status who achieved sufficient levels after supplementation with either 100,000 IU vitamin D3 every 4 weeks over 12 months 83 or 5,000 IU vitamin D3 or 0.25 \u03bcg calcitriol every 4 weeks over 12 months 78 resulted in no impact on AECOPD 78,83 or lung function outcomes. 83 Finally, improvement in AECOPD severity and symptoms was found in those with deficient BL 25(OH)D levels who achieved insufficient levels after supplementation with 120,000 IU vitamin D3 every 2 months over 12 months, but there was no impact on lung function or other AECOPD outcomes. 95\nThe remaining three studies either did not report subjects\u2019 post-supplementation vitamin D status, 80 combined subjects and controls in reporting pre\u2013post supplementation status, 97 or did not report pre\u2013post supplementation vitamin D status. 98 In those with insufficient 25(OH)D levels (subjects\u00a0+ controls), supplementation with 2,000 IU vitamin D3 per day for 6 months resulted in reduced AECOPDs. 97 Supplementation with 200,000 IU vitamin D3 intramuscularly every 4 weeks for 6 months resulted in no impact on lung function outcomes. 80 Finally, supplementation with 100,000 IU vitamin D3 every month for 6 months resulted in improvement in lung outcomes and a reduction in AECOPDs, but pre\u2013post supplementation 25(OH)D levels were not reported. 98\nComorbidities should be considered before starting vitamin D supplementation 100,101 and vitamin D dosage is based on age, BW, and BL 25(OH)D level. Vitamin D should be administered according to local protocol or national clinical guidelines 101 and clinical expertise. 100,102 Coordination with the prescribing provider may be required for vitamin D supplement orders. Achievement of normal serum 25(OH)D levels may not be possible in all instances. Therefore, optimizing serum 25(OH)D levels is the goal. 103\nRecommendation 9. COPD: Monitor and Evaluate Energy Intake and Body Weight for Energy Needs\nFor adults with COPD, the RDN should routinely monitor and evaluate BW status and energy intake and adjust the estimated calorie prescription to achieve or maintain an optimal weight. Evidence suggests an association between BW status and both mortality and lung function in adults with COPD. Strong evidence indicates that the lowest BMI groups had higher mortality rates compared to higher BMI groups. Furthermore, a BMI classification of approximately 25.0 to 29.99 appeared to lower risk of mortality compared to both higher and lower BMI classifications. In primarily unadjusted results, fair evidence suggests that BMI was positively associated with FEV 1% predicted and FEV 1 /FVC. Increasing BMI was also shown to reduce longitudinal declines in these measures over time. Fair evidence was also found showing improvement in dyspnea scores with higher energy intakes. Rating: Fair; Imperative\nRationale: The evidence supporting this recommendation is described in Recommendation 1. COPD: Assessment of Energy Intake; Recommendation 2. COPD: Assessment of Body Weight; and Recommendation 3. COPD: Assessment of Energy Needs. The recommendation provides for monitoring and evaluation of the energy prescription, as described in the Recommendation 6. COPD: Energy Prescription.\nOver time, the monitoring of BW against energy intake is probably the most meaningful expression of energy requirement in COPD. If adverse changes in BW or composition are occurring, equal attention should be paid to the possibility that the patient is not consuming up to the target intake, or that the target intake is not correct. An optimal BW goal should be individualized for each patient.\nRecommendation 10. COPD: Monitor and Evaluate Serum 25(OH)D Levels\nThe RDN should periodically check serum 25(OH)D levels in adults with COPD as part of routine nutrition monitoring and evaluation. Evidence from 60% of studies reviewed, found positive associations between serum 25(OH)D and lung function measures. Rating: Fair; Imperative\nRationale: The evidence supporting this recommendation is described in Recommendation 4.1. COPD: Assessment of Serum 25(OH)D Levels. If serum 25(OH)D laboratory data are not available, the RDN should use professional judgment to request or obtain additional data.\nRecommendation 11. COPD: Monitor and Evaluate Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation\nIn adults with COPD who are receiving vitamin D supplementation, the RDN should monitor and evaluate the effect of the supplementation regimen on serum 25(OH)D levels. If BL serum 25(OH)D levels are \u226410 ng/mL (\u226425 nmol/L), the RDN should also evaluate the frequency of exacerbations to measure the effectiveness of supplementation. Evidence from adults with COPD with BL serum 25(OH)D levels \u226410 ng/mL (\u226425 nmol/L) showed that vitamin D supplementation decreased exacerbations. While vitamin D is important for general health, vitamin D supplementation in those with BL serum 25(OH)D levels of 11 to 29 ng/mL (27.5 to 72.5 nmol/L) may or may not improve lung function or reduce exacerbations in adults with COPD. Rating: Fair; Conditional\nRationale: The evidence supporting this recommendation is described in Recommendation 4.2. COPD: Assessment of Exacerbations and Recommendation 8. COPD: Vitamin D Supplementation. The recommendation applies to adults with COPD with BL serum 25(OH)D levels of <29 ng/mL (<72.5 nmol/L) and in whom vitamin D supplements have been initiated, and in COPD patients with BL serum 25(OH)D levels of \u226410 ng/mL (\u226425 nmol/L) who may also have frequent exacerbations (two or more exacerbations per year. 85,86\nCoordination with the prescribing provider may be required for recommended changes to vitamin D supplementation and physician orders. Achievement of normal serum 25(OH)D levels may not be possible in all instances. Therefore, optimizing serum 25(OH)D levels is the goal. 103 Frequency of monitoring serum 25(OH)D levels post-supplementation should be at 3-month intervals. 103\nSummary of Recommendations\nThe focus of this publication is to present updated nutrition guidelines for the care and treatment of patients with COPD based on the EAL systematic review. The SR found Grade I (Good/Strong) evidence that MNT intervention provided by an RDN (or international equivalent) as part of a multidisciplinary program improved BW, QOL, and exercise capacity outcomes in adults with COPD. In addition, groups with the lowest BMI had higher mortality rates compared to groups with higher BMI. A BMI of approximately 25.0 to 29.99 (considered overweight) appeared to lower risk of mortality compared to both higher and lower BMI classifications. Grade II (Fair) evidence was found for several topics. In adults with COPD, MNT intervention by an RDN as part of a multidisciplinary team improved body composition and lung function outcomes. There was improvement in dyspnea scores with higher energy intakes. Vitamin D supplementation improved exacerbation outcomes in those with serum 25(OH)D levels of \u226410 ng/mL (\u226425 nmol/L), and evidence from 60% of studies reviewed found positive associations between serum 25(OH)D and lung function measures. Finally, in primarily unadjusted results, a positive association was found between BMI and FEV 1% predicted and FEV 1 /FVC. Increasing BMI was also shown to reduce the longitudinal declines in these measures over time. Grade III (Weak) evidence was found for predicting resting and total energy expenditure of adults with COPD and for macronutrient composition (percent distribution) of the diet.\nStrengths and Limitations\nA defining strength of this work is the rigorous and transparent methodology used to conduct the SR and to develop the EBNPG. Major weaknesses of this review were the substantial number of inconsistencies found within the body of evidence meeting the inclusion criteria, which made formulation of specific recommendations challenging. The following are the limitations of the SR:\n\u2022\nThe effectiveness of MNT intervention alone, not as part of a multidisciplinary program such as pulmonary rehabilitation, has rarely been evaluated. In addition, few studies reported the qualifications and credentials of the individuals providing MNT, or the number, frequency, and length of nutrition visits. No studies were conducted in the United States.\n\u2022\nThere is great variability in outcomes of studies of adults with COPD. Because of the systemic nature of COPD, a wide variety of outcomes are studied and range from pulmonary function tests, to inflammatory biomarkers, to self-reports of QOL. The scope of this project required narrowing the outcomes to those most commonly studied and considered to be of high importance in COPD (ie, pulmonary function tests). However, these outcomes may not be the outcomes most strongly impacted by nutrition interventions and, therefore, our review might have missed important benefits.\n\u2022\nLimited data were available to determine the effect of macronutrient composition (ie, percentage of calories from carbohydrate, protein, and fat) on outcomes in ambulatory patients with COPD. While this topic has been explored more extensively in intubated patients, or patients hospitalized in intensive care units, it is unknown whether these findings are translatable to other COPD populations.\n\u2022\nThe main limitations for the RMR and TEE prediction questions were a small number of studies and, therefore, few subjects, various inclusion or exclusion of equations, and inconsistent application of validation statistics. Only five studies were available on which to base recommendations, for a combined samples size of 184. While some equations were included in all five studies, other equations were tested in only one or two. Some studies included bias statistics, but not all. Few included accuracy rates. Bland-Altman statistics were commonly used, but they were not always reported in the same way. One general trend in the data is for the equations for RMR for healthy people to overestimate the measured RMR for COPD patients (these patients were not in exacerbation at the time of measurement). The single exception to this trend occurred in a study in which exhaled air was collected via facemask (in all other studies a canopy system was used), so the exception may have been the result of methodological factors rather than metabolic.\n\u2022\nStudies of vitamin D supplementation included in this review varied widely in terms of dosing, timing, delivery routes, length of intervention, BL serum 25(OH)D levels, and outcomes studied. In addition, not all studies reported both pre- and post-supplementation serum 25(OH)D levels. While our review did demonstrate that serum 25(OH)D levels may be associated with outcomes in patients with COPD patients, the variability in supplementation trials makes specific recommendations for timing and dosage of vitamin D difficult at this time.\n\u2022\nStudies examining the association of serum 25(OH)D levels with outcomes varied in terms of outcomes measured and categorization of serum 25(OH)D levels.\n\u2022\nBecause the evidence for a number of outcomes was conflicting, very limited, or there was no evidence found, not all SR conclusions could be used to develop and support (or refute) recommendations.\nSuggestions for Future Research\nThis review established a role for nutrition in the management of patients with COPD, and future high-quality research is needed to continue to expand and define optimal treatment strategies. Some specific suggestions include:\n\u2022\nDevelop and consistently use a standardized list of the most important outcomes in the nutrition management of COPD.\n\u2022\nExamine the role of patient-reported outcomes (eg, patient perception of well-being, energy level, and breathing) because these subjective parameters are important in evaluating nutrition interventions.\n\u2022\nInvestigate the impact of independent MNT on COPD outcomes, including the frequency and duration of visits.\n\u2022\nDetermine whether any current equations for predicting RMR are valid in adults with COPD. A more uniform set of statistics to define validity would be helpful in this effort, and the research should extend to hospitalized as well as free-living individuals.\n\u2022\nExamine vitamin D supplementation more extensively, including dosing, timing, delivery routes, and length of intervention to achieve optimal serum 25(OH)D concentrations in adults with COPD.\n\u2022\nInvestigate optimal serum 25(OH)D levels to protect against the loss of lung function and exacerbations, as well as the development of comorbid conditions, that occur with COPD.\n\u2022\nExpand research on BW (eg, BMI) to include the effect of body composition and/or changes in body composition, such as FFM and fat mass, on COPD outcomes.\n\u2022\nDetermine appropriate macronutrient distributions to optimize COPD outcomes using RCTs with a large sample size and standardized protocols.\nPractice Implications\nThe Academy\u2019s EAL EBNPGs promote the application of a consistent approach to quality clinical practice with a goal of achieving positive patient outcomes. The 2019 EBNPG for adults with COPD are based on the findings of the SR and include the following recommendations aligned under the NCP: MNT by an RDN should be provided to improve patient outcomes in adults with COPD. To calculate RMR, the RDN may use either the WHO (including height) equation or the HBE. If body composition is known (FFM, body fat), the RDN may use the Westerterp equation. To calculate TEE in nonobese adults, the RDN may use 30 kcal/kg BW to estimate energy needs. The calorie prescription should be individualized based on a nutrition assessment of energy intake, BW, or changes in BW and estimated energy needs and these factors should be routinely monitored and adjustments made to the estimated calorie prescription to achieve or maintain an optimal weight. The main recourse for the dietitian is to calculate the metabolic rate as a target for energy intake, but if the individual is losing weight, the dietitian must keep in mind the distinct possibility that the target energy intake is in error. The macronutrient composition of the diet should also be individualized, based on nutrition assessment. Serum 25(OH)D levels should be assessed and, if insufficient or deficient, vitamin D supplementation should be considered to optimize serum 25(OH)D status. If the patient is having two or more exacerbations per year, serum 25(OH)D levels should be obtained. If 25(OH)D levels are \u226410 ng/mL (\u226425 nmol/L), vitamin D supplementation should be advised by the RDN. In patients receiving vitamin D supplementation, the RDN should monitor and evaluate the effect of the supplementation regimen on serum 25(OH)D levels. If BL serum 25(OH)D levels were \u226410 ng/mL (\u226425 nmol/L), the RDN should also evaluate the frequency of exacerbations to measure the effectiveness of supplementation.\nThis EBNPG does not address hospitalized patients with COPD who are in the intensive care unit. Credentialed nutrition and dietetics practitioners are encouraged to explore other guidelines for information on the management of acutely ill or intubated patients, or patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.\nPatients with COPD are at high risk for both pulmonary and systemic complications of their disease. MNT can be an integral component of lifestyle treatment targeted at maintaining and improving outcomes, such as lung function, mortality, QOL, and the myriad of comorbidities associated with the disease. It is imperative that RDNs continuously apply the NCP steps to individualize and adjust the nutrition prescription based on each patient\u2019s response to MNT over time. The EAL 2019 COPD EBNPG provides 14 nutrition recommendations presented within the NCP framework and is a valuable resource for credentialed nutrition and dietetics practitioners and other health care professionals caring for those with COPD.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the following who served as workgroup members during the course of this project: Katie Braun, MS, RDN, LD, CNSC; Wendy Castle, MPH, RD, LD; Heather Cunningham, MS, RD, CNSC; Fritha Dinwiddie, MS, RD, CSG, LD; Edna Fiore, MT (ASCP) (patient advocate); Janice James, MS, RDN, CDN, CDE; Margaret (Peggy) Lange, MNS, RDN; Susan Meyer, MS, RDN-AP, LD, CNSC; and Todd Pierce (patient advocate).
