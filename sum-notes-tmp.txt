1-2: Lipids are structurally and functionally diverse and are found in many foods and synthetic compounds. The most abundant lipids are triacylglycerols (TAGs) used by plants for dense energy storage. Some lipids have to be consumed by humans while others are highly recommended to prevent disease. This chapter defines the chemical structure of the most relevant lipids (fatty acids, TAGs, and phospholipids), describes their synthesis, lists the percentage of lipids in various fruits and vegetables, and how they relate to humans.
